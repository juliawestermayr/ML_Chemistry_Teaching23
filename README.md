# MSC Course on  "Machine Learning: Fundamentals and Applications in Chemistry"

Jupyter notebooks for the Master ML courses at Leipzig University


For a basic introduction into python, pandas, plotting, etc. I highly recommend the notebooks by the Schwaller group at EPFL, see here: https://schwallergroup.github.io/ai4chem_course/
